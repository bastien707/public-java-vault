In Java, abstraction is achieved by interfaces and abstract classes. We can achieve 100% abstraction using interfaces.

Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.

### Abstraction vs Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the packing of _"data"_ and _"functions operating on that data"_ into a single component and restricting the access to some of the object's components.  
Encapsulation means that the internal representation of an object is generally hidden from view outside of the object's definition.

Abstraction is a mechanism which represent the essential features without including implementation details.

> _Encapsulation:_ ⇒  **Information hiding**.  
> _Abstraction:_ ⇒  **Implementation hiding**

> Encapsulation means hiding data like using getter and setter etc.
> Abstraction means hiding implementation using abstract class and interfaces etc.
