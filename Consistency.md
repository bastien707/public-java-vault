*CohÃ©rence in French*

A Transaction should respect the database rules. This mean if there is a rule that specify a sold cannot be negative, any transaction can achieve this.

Consistency ensures that a database remains in a valid state before and after a transaction. It guarantees that any transaction will take the database from one consistent state to another, **maintaining the rules and constraints defined for the data**.
