High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces). Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

**Decoupling**: Reduces the coupling between high-level and low-level modules.

**Flexibility**: Makes the system more flexible and easier to refactor or extend.
