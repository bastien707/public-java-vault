**Eager Fetching** is a fetching strategy where **related data is loaded immediately along with the primary entity**. This approach can simplify data access patterns at the cost of potentially loading more data than necessary.

The drawbacks are **fetching unnecessary data** which impact the performance  and the **cascade fetching**. Â For example, fetching a User entity might also fetch all related Orders, which in turn fetch all related OrderItems, and so on.
