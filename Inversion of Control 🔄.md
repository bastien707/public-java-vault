Inversion of Control is the fact of **inverting the flow of control by letting the framework (Spring) control the execution flow**. It enables the developer concentrate on the business logic while the framework handle object creation, lifecycle management etc. Spring's IoC manage application objects called Beans.

Instead of the developer uses a library, with
IoC, the framework uses the developer's code
