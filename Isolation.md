Ensures that **multiple transactions can occur concurrently without leading to the inconsistency** of the database state. Transactions occur independently without interference. Changes occurring in a particular transaction will not be visible to any other transaction until that particular change in that transaction is written to memory or has been committed.
This property ensures that when multiple transactions run at the same time, **the result will be the same as if they were run one after another in a specific order**.
