The **JRE** is the **Java Runtime Environment**. It is a package of everything necessary to run a compiled Java program, including the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the Java Class Library, the `java` command, and other infrastructure. However, it **cannot be used to create new programs.**

Usually, if you only care about running Java programs on computer you will only install the JRE. It's all you need. On the other hand, if you are planning to do some Java programming, you need to install the JDK instead.
