The JVM is part of the JRE and is responsible for running Java bytecode. The JVM interprets or compiles (using Just-In-Time compilation) the bytecode and executes it on the underlying hardware. The JVM is what makes Java platform-independent, allowing the same bytecode to run on any device or operating system that has a compatible JVM.

There are different JVM for example **hotspot** or **openj9**
