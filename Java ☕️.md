Java is a high-level, [[Object]]-oriented programming language known for its platform independence. It allows developers to write code once and run it anywhere using the [[Java Virtual Machine]] (JVM).

Different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.) have their own JVM implementations, but they all follow the same specifications, ensuring compatibility.

Java is compiled and interpreted language.
Compiled from java to bytecode. Bytecode are interpreted and JIT may compiled them into native instruction for optimization.
