Hibernate is an ORM which stands for **Object Relational Mapping**. **It's an implementation of JPA specification.**

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is the **process of converting Java objects to database tables**. In other words, this allows us to interact with a relational database without any SQL.

Hibernate enables the relationship between the object and the database.

We can use Hibernate without JPA. Hibernate release before JPA in 2001.
