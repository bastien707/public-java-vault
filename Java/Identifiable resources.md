Everything is represented by a resource this can be a Car, a Cart, a Customer.
In REST, resources are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed. Each resource **must be uniquely identifiable**.

Resources are identified using Uniform Resource Identifiers (**URIs**). For example, a resource representing a user might be accessed via the URI `/users/{userId}`
