The collection framework is a set of interfaces and classes in Java that are used to represent and manipulate collections of objects in a variety of ways.

The collection framework contains classes(ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, TreeSet) and multiple interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) where every interface is used to store a specific type of data.
