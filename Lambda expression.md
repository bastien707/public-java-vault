A **lambda expression** in Java is a concise way to represent an anonymous function that can be passed as an argument, stored in a variable, or used to define the behavior of functional interfaces. Unlike methods, lambda expressions do not need a name and can be implemented right where they are needed.
### Characteristics
- **Anonymous**: Lambdas are unnamed functions.
- **Concise Syntax**: They allow for shorter and more readable code.
- **Functional Interface**: Lambdas are used to implement the single abstract method of a functional interface (an interface with exactly one abstract method).
