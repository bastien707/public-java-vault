**Map Reduce is an algorithm data processing model used for large data sets.** Consists of Map and Reduce functions.

**Map function:** takes an input key-value pair and produces a set of intermediate key-value pairs. The purpose of the Map function is to process input data and convert it into a more useful format for the Reduce function.

**Reduce function:** takes the intermediate key-value pairs produced by the Map function and merges them together to produce a smaller set of values. The purpose of the Reduce function is to aggregate, summarize, or transform the data into the final output.
