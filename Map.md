Map is a two-dimensional data structure in Java that is used to store the data in the form of a Key-Value pair. The key here is the unique hashcode and value represent the element. Map in Java is another form of the Java Set but canâ€™t contain duplicate elements.

Map does not implement the `Collection` interface.
