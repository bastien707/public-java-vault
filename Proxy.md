A **proxy** is an object that acts as an intermediary or placeholder for another object. In the context of [[Spring AOP]], a proxy is used to intercept method calls to the target object and apply aspects (such as logging, security, or transactions) before, after, or around the method execution.

It happens at runtime in the context of Spring application.
