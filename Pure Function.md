A pure function has two main properties:

1. A pure function **return values are identical for identical arguments** 
2. A pure function has **no side effects** (i.e assigns no values to variables, etc).

The main difference between mathematical function and programming function is thatÂ **mathematical functions are always pure**. 

Let's take an example : $f(x) = x^2 + 4x$. For the same $x$ we get always the same output. If you give $x = 2$ you'll always get $12$.
