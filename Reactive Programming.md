Reactive programming is based on the idea of asynchronous event processing. This means that the processing of an event does not block the processing of other events. It focuses on building applications that **react to changes in data and events in real-time**.

One of the core concept is data stream, which is a timed-ordered sequence of event messages. These streams are often represented as **observables** which emit data over time, this allows the developers to work with asynchronous data flows effectively.

One of the key features of reactive programming is the automatic propagation of changes. When a value in a reactive system changes, **all dependent values are automatically updated** without the need for explicit re-computation.
