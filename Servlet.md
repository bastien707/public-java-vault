A servlet is a program that runs on the server side as an extension of the server. It receives a request from the client, performs processing and returns the result.

Basically, web servers are only capable of returning files present on the server in response to a client request. However, to enable the sending of an HTML page containing, for example, a list of items meeting various criteria, this HTML page needs to be dynamically created. Several solutions exist for this purpose. Java servlets are one such solution.
