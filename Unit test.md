**Unit tests are designed to test individual components or units of code in isolation**, typically at the function or method level. This helps ensure that each part of the code works as intended on its own.
#### Characteristics

- **Fast Execution**: Unit tests are usually fast to execute because they test small pieces of code and do not require extensive setup or teardown.
- **Isolation**: They mock or stub dependencies to isolate the unit being tested, ensuring that failures in tests are not due to external factors.
- **Frequent Runs**: They are often run frequently during development (e.g., as part of a continuous integration process) to catch issues early.
